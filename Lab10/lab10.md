##Lab 10

In lab 10, we spent some time working with Arduinos
After installing the IDE, getting the blink program working was simple enough

Next up was Hello World, was also simple enough

Manaing the serial we ran into a few problems (notably the arduino losing power on us or something) but after a few computer swaps
the problem was solved, from there implementing bumping a serial input to the screen was a few lines of code away!

We spent a good amount of time attempting to get the newline function working (notably detecting when a newline character was used and splitting
the line up correctly

Unfortunately, we did not have time after this for the clock, but here is a link to the finished code for the rest
