# Lab 4 - Documentation

For lab 4, I decided that looking around the freebsd website, especially the newbie sections, was a good way to find some issues that need
correcting. 

On the intro page I found a link that wasn't working (the Installation Instructions link)

Finding it in the repository and modifying file appropriately (with diff file!)

Got an email back from them confirming my change has been added!

## Open Source vs Proprietary Debate

Arguements for Open Source
-Better quality of software with more heads looking at a problem
-Better fits the needs of the users as they can modify it as they see fit
-Support from a wide range of users
-Problems will get dealt with
-No need for licensing issues
-Can be extended if needed


Arguements for Proprietary
-Easier for a developer to make money off thier work as it cannot be distributed
-Harder to slip malicious code into something so controlled
-Allows someone to be responsible for a program
-People know they are getting YOUR product
-Tighter Security

Reasons to choose one or the other
If you want complete control over your program, choose Proprietary
If you want assistance from a community in development choose open source


Side Project?
Open source. If someone else can use it after I've written it then why should they not be able to use it

Starting a company?
Honestly open source as well, makes it easier to form a community for feedback, assistance, hires ect.
